The adaptive linear neuron (Adaline; Widrow, 1962) is a simple, fundamental unit that has previously been used in ANNs. Adalineâ€™s adaptation mechanism arises from the determination of the best set of weights between a given input and the desired associated output, such that the mean squared error (MSE) is minimized
